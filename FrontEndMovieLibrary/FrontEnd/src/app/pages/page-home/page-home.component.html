<br><h2>Overview of Movies Library</h2>
<p>
  Spring Boot and Angular form a powerful tandem that works great for developing web applications with a minimal footprint.<br>
  In this aplication we can search movies by filter ,add ,update and Delete , we'll use Spring Boot for implementing a RESTful backend, and Angular for creating a frontend.
</p><p>
  Our demo web application's functionality will be pretty simplistic indeed. Users will be able to create their movies (or select movies if they already exist in the Json File ).
</p>
<h3>The Spring Boot Application :</h3>
<p>
  Our demo web application's functionality will be pretty simplistic indeed. It will be just narrowed to retrieving data from a "data/movies.json" file using REST Api services exposed at http://localhost:8080/api/movie. The Api controller contains view, creation, update, search and delete services.
</p>
<h3>The Angular Application :</h3>
<p>
  With our demo Spring Boot application up and running, the Angular application, capable of consuming the REST controller API.<br>
  It is possible de view all data or to use an index to search one object. There is also another service, based on a key-value search criteria. In addition, a delete and update operations are available to modify objects list content. An integrity check is added before every process to control input parameters.
